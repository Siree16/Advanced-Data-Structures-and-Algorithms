## Assignment 1 üìÖ (Deadline: 21 August, 2023 11:59 PM)

### Objective
Rutvik and his team are working on optimizing a file system for a cutting-edge operating system called NextOS. Your task is to compare two different data structures to optimize file insertion, searching, and deleting operations.

### Task
1. **Implement two data structures**:
   - A custom data structure (other than red-black tree)
   - A red-black tree

2. **Compare their performance**:
   - Measure the time taken for insertion, searching, and deleting operations.

### Input
1. The first line contains data to construct both data structures.
2. The second line contains keys to be inserted into both data structures.
3. The third line contains keys to be retrieved from both data structures.
4. The fourth line contains keys to be deleted from both data structures.

### Output
- Provide a detailed performance analysis, explaining the time taken by your algorithm and the red-black tree for each operation.

### Question Breakdown
1. **Question 1 (Marks: 10)**: Efficient File System Indexing: Performance Analysis
2. **Question 2 (Marks: 05)**: Convert an arbitrary n-node binary search tree to a given n-node binary search tree.
3. **Question 3 (Marks: 05)**: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using Red Black Tree.

## Assignment 3 üìÖ (Deadline: 05 October, 2023 11:59 PM)

### Objective
Bikash is working on compiler optimization, specifically register allocation. The goal is to efficiently assign program variables to CPU registers.

### Task
1. **Register Allocation**:
   - Write a function or program that takes the number of variables (N) and the number of dependencies/conflicts (E) between these variables.
   - Determine the minimum number of registers required for optimized allocation.

### Input
- An integer N (1 <= N <= 1000): Number of program variables.
- An integer E (1 <= E <= 5000): Number of dependencies/conflicts.
- U: List of source program variables.
- V: List of destination program variables.
- N lines follow with dependencies/conflicts.

### Output
- Return the minimum number of registers needed.

### Question Breakdown
1. **Question 1 (Marks: 10)**: Register Allocation with dependencies.
2. **Question 2 (Marks: 10)**: Implement the above without using a table data structure and highlight the differences in terms of time or space in the report.
